"Pac-Man" is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1980 by Namco. Created by Toru Iwatani, it quickly became one of the most iconic and enduring video games in history. In Pac-Man, players control a circular, yellow character named Pac-Man, navigating a maze filled with pellets while being pursued by colorful ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal is to eat all the pellets while avoiding the ghosts. Power pellets temporarily turn the tables, allowing Pac-Man to chase and eat the ghosts for bonus points. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay and distinctive characters have made it a cultural phenomenon, influencing popular culture and video game design for decades.
